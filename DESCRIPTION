Description: Results pathways are usually based on a theory of change describing
    how change is assumed to come about through intervention/s in a prevailing
    situation. The theory is laid out in a diagram showing the connections
    between interventions and outcomes - the results pathways. From an
    epidemiological perspective, these results pathways can be conceived as
    directed acyclic graphs (DAG) more specifically those concerned with 
    structural causal models that portray causal assumptions about a set of 
    variables. Causal DAGs are consistent and easy to understand. Thus, when 
    assessing the causal effect between an intervention and an outcome, drawing 
    assumptions in the form of a DAG can help in picking the right model without 
    necessarily having the mathematical basis behind it. Another way to think 
    about DAGs is as non-parametric structural equation models (SEM) which 
    explicitly lays out paths between variables. In the case of a DAG, the 
    exact relationship between the two variables is not as important, only its 
    direction. The rules underpinning DAGs are consistent whether the 
    relationship is da simple, linear one, or a more complicated function.
